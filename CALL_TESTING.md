- **Enhanced**: Better audio constraints with echo cancellation, noise suppression
- **Improved**: Proper audio track management throughout call lifecycle

### 3. Real-time Connection Issues ✅
- **Fixed**: Enhanced WebRTC peer connection setup with multiple STUN servers
- **Improved**: Better ICE candidate handling and processing
- **Enhanced**: Proper signaling state management
- **Added**: Connection state monitoring and feedback

### 4. Time Synchronization ✅
- **Fixed**: Call duration now synced using shared start time from Firebase

- **Improved**: Accurate duration calculation based on connection establishment

## Technical Improvements

### WebRTC Configuration
- Added multiple Google STUN servers for better connectivity
- Enhanced offer/answer creation with proper constraints
- Improved ICE candidate collection and processing
- Better error handling for peer connection states

### Media Handling
- Enhanced getUserMedia with better constraints:
  - Audio: Echo cancellation, noise suppression, auto gain control
  - Video: HD quality (1280x720, 30fps) for better video calls
- Proper track management with enable/disable instead of stop/start
- Better cleanup of media streams when call ends

### State Management
- Added connection state tracking
- Improved call status updates
- Better error state handling
- Enhanced UI feedback for different call states

### UI/UX Improvements
- Video calls now show video properly when connected
- Better placeholder content during connection phase
- Improved mobile responsiveness
- Enhanced visual feedback for call states

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Voice Call Test
1. Open two browser windows/tabs
2. Login as different users (business and customer)
3. Initiate a voice call from either side
4. Verify:
   - ✅ Audio is clearly audible on both sides
   - ✅ Mute/unmute functionality works
   - ✅ Call timer shows accurate duration
   - ✅ Call connects within 5-10 seconds

### 2. Video Call Test
1. Open two browser windows/tabs
2. Login as different users
3. Initiate a video call
4. Verify:
   - ✅ Both users can see each other's video
   - ✅ Local video shows in corner
   - ✅ Remote video fills main screen
   - ✅ Camera on/off functionality works
   - ✅ Audio works alongside video

### 3. Connection Quality Test
1. Start a call and verify connection establishes quickly
2. Check browser console for ICE connection states
3. Verify call timer syncs between both users
4. Test mute/unmute during active call
5. Test camera on/off during video call

## Troubleshooting

### If Audio Doesn't Work
- Check browser permissions for microphone access
- Verify audio devices are working in system settings
- Check browser console for getUserMedia errors

### If Video Doesn't Show
- Check browser permissions for camera access
- Verify camera is not being used by another application
- Check browser console for video track errors

### If Connection Fails
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify STUN server accessibility
- Check browser console for WebRTC errors
- Try refreshing both browsers

## Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome/Chromium (Recommended)
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari (may have limitations)
- ✅ Edge

## Performance Notes
- Video calls use more bandwidth than voice calls
- HD video quality (720p) requires stable internet
- Call quality automatically adjusts based on network conditions
- Mobile devices may have varying performance based on hardware
