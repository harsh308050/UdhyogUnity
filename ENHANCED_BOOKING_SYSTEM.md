# Enhanced Booking System for UdhyogUnity

This enhancement adds powerful new features to the service booking system, improving the user experience for both customers and businesses.

## New Features

### Enhanced User Bookings
- **Calendar-based view** of bookings categorized by upcoming, past, and cancelled
- **Reschedule functionality** that allows users to request booking time changes
- **Payment method information** display for each booking
- **Improved status indicators** with color coding and icons
- **Expanded booking details** with collapsible sections
- **Better review system integration** for completed bookings

### Usage
The enhanced booking system can be enabled or disabled using the `BookingSelector.jsx` file:

```jsx
// Set this to true to use the enhanced version, false to use the legacy version
const USE_ENHANCED_BOOKINGS = true;
```

## Implementation Details

### Components
- `EnhancedUserBookings.jsx` - The new enhanced booking component for customers
- `EnhancedUserBookings.css` - Styling for the enhanced component
- `BookingSelector.jsx` - Toggle between legacy and enhanced versions
- `LegacyUserBookings.jsx` - Original booking component (renamed)

### How It Works
The system now supports:
1. **Reschedule Requests** - Users can request to reschedule a booking with a new date/time and reason
2. **Enhanced Status Tracking** - Additional status types like "reschedule_requested" and "rescheduled"
3. **Payment Method Display** - Shows whether the booking was paid online or will be paid at the store
